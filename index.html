           <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
  <p>While I make this, I am one month into my 'rebound' year. My first introduction to coding and HTML is actually quite smooth. Everything is a learning curve, but if you do create good habits, then life is easy. Habits don't mean habitually doing something, it's about habitually PLANNING everything out, then acting on it.
  For example, when making my the 'Digital Walkthough', it was a lot of trial and error. I kept chipping away at it, error by error. I can easily be entranced with a piece of work I am ironing out.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
  <p>Feedback from classmates and professors is always beneficial. Even though I may not come to my piers imediately with my problems, I'm always listening up to others' problems. Then,, I can solve problems that I have in common with them. Anecdotally, I believe in submitting projects on the day they're due, so I can see what others are accomplishing, and potentially "steal" like an artist.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
  <p>I'd love to progress my skill with this craft. I have a good sense of creativity and unlimited passion, so all it is now is honing in on the craft. There are many crafts associated with just this website, or even in writing this paragraph. So, to point to a specific example: after completing the AI art installation, I thought I could build off the idea, and incorperate the art into something interactive and relatable. </p>

       <h3 class="margin">Phase 2 Course Goals</h3>

    <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
    <p>This is where my previous knowledge really shined. When the class was introduced to Adobe, I was interested in what the assignments would be. I feel as though I've always had a creative mind when it comes to creating and shooting content through a camera. When I went to take B-Roll, the first shot or two are never the best, but after feeling warmed up to taking video of strangers and the public, shooting feels natural and unintrusive if you do it right.</p>
       <br>
          <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
    <p>Throughout the semester, we had research to complete. When we shared in class, I always listened to others research. Most of the time, I would only consider the technical research, HTML hacks and Adobe efficiency boosters. However, once in a while, I may find that an article that one finds on cybersecurity maybe links with another's on factory farming. It is a lot easier to make connections between people's fields than one might think.</p>
        <br>
          <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
    <p>I have always been a fan of YouTube. Since I had my first school-distributed iPad in 2014, YouTube has been my main source for content and entertainment. Naturally, I grew fond of Casey Neistat, a content creator and possibly most notable video creator on the platform. He thinks deeply about craft, turning small, everyday happenings into bite-sized, easy-to-digest content that anyone can pick up and put down at any time. I though of way to make that a part of my craft, and I think I did a good job when it came to the editing and production of the films.</p>
        <br>
              <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
    <p>In terms of research, the bulk of it was put into reseaching bike issues, solutions, and information to better assist my understanding about how bike networks function and how to upgrade existing roads. Again, much of mny learning was done through other's articles, and YouTube documentary-style movies ocnsisting of primary source after primary source.</p>
        <br>
              <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
    <p>In terms of editing and presentation, I have always been proud of my work. I think I learned more techniques about piecing clips together and recording, but much of my editing skill has stuck with me for quite some time. I'm not defering the class, however, as I learned a multitude of ease-of-life funcitons, like Premiere Pro's content tray, and Lightroom's copy and paste method.</p>

    <h3>Phase 3/4 Course Goals</h3> <br>
    <h4><em>1.	Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
    <p>As the semester went on, I picked up more and more creative habits. HTML got easier as I used the portfolio and installation toolkits. When the break hit, I used that time to try and chisel away any imperfections in my work, and although I know I did not finish 100%, any amount of polish is good polish.</p>
       <br>
          <h4><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
    <p>The presentation helped me talk out the project to myself. Other;s may have seen it as just an expose for my project, but I took it as a reflection opportunity to truly buckle down on the topic and start to develop ideas for my final project. The installation presentations during the final class of the year were more of the expose, museum and display style that I took many critiques from and hope to incorperate in the polish version and in any other future projects.</p>
        <br>
          <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
    <p>It was back to the slow chipping away of the HTML grind, but first, GIF time! Taking what I had learned from the begining of the year about HTML with the handfull of tips I revieced from my piers, I thought I had a strong shot at producing a visually appealing presentation and final project, and that I did. if I do say so myself.</p>
        <br>
          <h4><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development</em></h4>
    <p>Most of the research was complete and now it was time to implement the ideas into physical and digital form. My skills sure did develop, however. Many trip to the W3 website for CSS lines and button code helped me understand, but more importantly, just messing around with my work so far and experimenting with what everything does.</p>
        <br>
              <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
    <p>To round everything off, I think I learned TONS from this class. I learned how to engage in proper research about a topic that interests me, and how to properly incorperate what I learned into an educational piece that others can take something away from. Presenting my work took a lot of determination in the final few hours, but I always seem to pull it through (I guess, that is if you don't count this portfolio).</p>
